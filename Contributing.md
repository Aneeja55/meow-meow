# How to contribute to this project

This is a very simple project aimed to get people started in contributing to opensource, get them familiar with git and Github.

1. Create a simple HTML file in the `pages` folder with anything that intrests you, add photos, some text and make it beautifull.

2. Add a link to the file in the `index.html` which would be something like 
```html
<a href="pages/{name of your file.html}"> My beautifull page </a>
```
